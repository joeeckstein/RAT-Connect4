## Cal Poly CPE 233-1 Project

Using the Basys3 this project creates a Connect4 game using VHDL and RATASM. The game does not feature win detection (in the works for v2.0). The board must be completely reset in order for another game to be played due to issues with memory initialization.

This project compiles in Vivado 2015.4
